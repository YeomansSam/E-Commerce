<h2 style="text-align:center;">Technologies and issues met by the site</h2>
<p sytle="text-align:centre;">There are quite a few ways that the Nintendo store exploits the technologies and issues that had been learned through the lectures. One example is the privacy policy that is used on the Nintendo store. The privacy policy is separated into three distinct categories. The first category is the information that the customer will provide to Nintendo. This is where you must register with the site before you can purchase any goods. Some of the information that must be provided are the customer name, username, password, telephone number, address and email address. They also require billing information which includes card number and expiry date. Other ways that the website collects information on you is through seeing what you have bought from their website and through answering surveys about their products. The second category of their privacy policy is the information that they automatically collect about the customer. They do this by using cookies on their website. There are five distinct types of cookies on their website. The first being for essential website purposes. These include storing items in your shopping basket and secure login. Next type of cookies is for functionality and performance on the website. These are used so that if you have bought something before on the website, you won’t have to enter your card details again. Plus, it is also used for watching videos on their website. The third type of cookie that is being used on the Nintendo site is analytics cookies which are used to understand how the website is being used. These types of cookies are not only used by Nintendo, but also google analytics. In addition to these cookies, The Nintendo store also has social media cookies which are used by Facebook and Twitter to share products form Nintendo’s website. The last time of cookie used is advertising cookies which will show Nintendo ads on different websites that you visit. This is done through google DoubleClick which uses the cookies.  The final part of the privacy policy is the information that they collect from third parties. Information that is collected from third parties are used to send emails and digital marketing ads that are better tailored for the customer.</p>
<p sytle="text-align:centre;">The Nintendo store website is also a secure website. It uses https as it’s security and what this means is that when you are paying for an item from Nintendo the user will have an encrypted connection between the user’s computer and the website. This is different compared to http as there is no encrypted connection between you and the website. This means that you’re credit card details are not secure and can easily be accessed by hackers. On Nintendo’s website they use an SSL encryption which allows them to have a https certificate which helps the website bring in more customers because this allows visitors to know that you are a genuine business. The website that Nintendo used to get the https certificate was Digicert.  </p>
<p sytle="text-align:centre;">On the Nintendo store website, they mostly use dynamic HTML. They use dynamic HTML for their images and drop-down menu. Examples of these are when you hover the mouse over consoles or games categories on the website, more options appear which is a use of dynamic HTML. Another instance of this is when you scroll down to shop by character and whichever character you hover over, a larger image will appear to the left of the options. However, this is only true if the customer accesses the file on a computer. If the customer where to access the webpage on a mobile device, then it would be using more static HTML. The reason why this happens is due to there being a program that only launches if the customer is viewing the page on the computer. The program that is being used is ‘Tracker.js’ which when used on the computer is how the website can keep track of mouse movement. However, because a mobile device like a smartphone does not have a mouse to keep track of movements, the program is not used. This means that on the mobile version of the website there are no drop-down menus and there is no shop by character option either.</p>
<p sytle="text-align:centre;">The Nintendo store website does not assume that you are accessing the webpage from a computer. Instead there is a program that runs before displaying the webpage. The way that the program works is that it will check to see if a computer or mobile device is trying to access the website. If it finds that the website is being accessed through a computer, it will then check to see what browser is being used to open the site. The reason why it checks the browser that is being used is because different browser’s display items differently to one another. This means that if you are accessing the website from one browser and compare the same site on another browser. It may display things differently or some features may not work as they are supposed to. If the program decides that you are accessing the website through a mobile device, it will then check to see which operating system is being used on that device. Once it has discovered the operating system it will then determine what device it is. This means that it will see if the device is a mobile phone or a tablet. It does this to see what size screen the device has and will adjust the size of the site to an optimal size. Once this is done the webpage will display.</p>
<p sytle="text-align:centre;">The types of payment that are accepted on the Nintendo store are credit cards and PayPal. This does give the customer the choice of using PayPal to pay rather than giving Nintendo your card detail as PayPal is a trustworthy site that many people use to pay for goods online. However, one good thing about using credit card on the site is that if you want to buy an item from them again another time, then the site will automatically remember your address and card details. This is convenient for customers as they don’t have to enter there details again on the website which will bring customers back to the site.</p>
<p sytle="text-align:centre;">One issue that affects the Nintendo store site would be cart abandonment. This is a problem which affects almost all e-commerce sites. Cart abandonment is when customers add an item to their baskets but then decide not to buy the item in their cart. In 2016 the percentage of customers who abandoned there carts online was 77.24%. This is a large amount of money that businesses are losing. One other rate that we look at is how much of all gaming products that where added to a cart got abandoned. The percentage of this was 64%. This can be used as a rough measurement of cart abandonment on the Nintendo site. There are many reasons why customers would abandon their shopping carts. One reason could be that customers didn’t want to pay for shipping. On the Nintendo store website, they will deliver the customers item for free if the customer has spent more than £20. However, if the customer spends less than £20 then they must spend another £1.99 on the item. This could affect sales because the item may be the same price on another website but doesn’t charge for delivery. Another reason could be that customers don’t like the return policy on the Nintendo website. The policy that Nintendo has for returns is that a customer has 14 days to return the item unopened and in perfect condition. This could affect the number of customers that buy from the website as they do not have a lot of time to see if they like the product and if they don’t like the item they can’t return it.  </p>
