<h2 style="text-align:center;">Value of the internet and e-commerce</h2>
<p sytle="text-align:centre;">The internet has many values that we as people take for granted in our day to day life’s. Some of these values are that we can access a vast amount of information that help us learn new things. The internet can also be accessed universally which allows us to communicate between other people from around the world. It also allows us to have freedom as no one owns the internet giving people more freedom of what they want to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:centre;">One major development that happened due to the internet was e-commerce. E-commerce allowed people to sell and buy goods online whenever and wherever they were. Some of the advantages that e-commerce has over the traditional way that we used to buy products is that there are no geographical limitations. What this means is that we can buy products that we want form anywhere around the world compared to the traditional way where you had to travel to a store and buy the item. In addition to this it eliminates the need to travel to a store because you can stay at home and search for the product online. One of the biggest advantages that e-commerce has over a high street store is that an e-commerce website is open all the time throughout the year. This makes it easier for the customer to buy the product that they want and allows the merchant to have an increase in sales.</p>
<p style="text-align:centre;">Technology has had a huge effect on supporting internet based commerce. On piece of technology that has had the biggest effect on internet based commerce is the computer. The reason why computers played a giant role in the beginning of internet based commerce is that it was the only way that customers and businesses could access the internet for e-commerce. In addition to computers, people now use smartphones to access e-commerce websites. The reason being is that a smartphone is more convenient to use then a computer. Plus, people carry their phones with them all day which means that if they go shopping on the high street they would then be able to compare the prices online to a high street and get a better deal.</p>
