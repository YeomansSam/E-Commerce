<h2 style="text-align:center;">The website</h2>
<p sytle="text-align:centre;">The website that I have chosen to do is the Nintendo Official UK Store. The primary purpose of the website is to sell Nintendo consoles, video games and accessories. They also sell Nintendo based goods such as t-shirts and mugs. The website is aimed for people who want to buy Nintendo based goods that they can’t get in any other retailers or online stores. It is also targeted at parents because if a parent wants to buy a Nintendo product for their children then they will probably go on the Nintendo website first to see how much the product costs. Lastly the website is aimed for children do to Nintendo being known for their kid friendly games.  The website does seem to work quite well because it separates their items into various categories such as consoles and games. They also separate the categories in an easier way for kids, through characters such as Mario and Pikachu.</p>
