<h2 style="text-align:center;">Future Tech</h2>
<p>For the future of the Nintendo store website there are a quite a lot of different technologies that they can use for the future. One technology is using drones to deliver the customers item on the day they order it. This would help the website as they could generate more money by offering same day delivery on all their games. </p>
<p>Another piece of technology that could be used is to have an app of the Nintendo Store. This would make it convenient for the customer if they wanted to buy an item as they wouldn’t have to type in the website every time they want to order something and would always keep the customer log into their account to order items quickly.</p>
<p>One other piece of technology that could be used on the Nintendo store website is apple pay and android pay. This would benefit Nintendo by allowing customers to have more choice in the way they want to pay for their items. This would also help Nintendo make more money by having customers pay for items quicker and more convenient for the customer.</p>
