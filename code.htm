<h2 style="text-align:center;">Code from website</h2>
<p>The Nintendo Store website uses some interesting code to get the website to feel dynamic. One piece of code that is used for this is the code below. </p>
<img src="Code.png" alt = "Code" width = "650" depth = "300"" height="490px" border="1px"></p>
<p>What this code does is when the user moves the mouse over one of the shop by character pictures. To the left of the pictures a full image of the character that was last hovered over will appear. This works through using another piece of code called ‘Tracker.js’ which is what the Nintendo store uses to keep track of where the mouse moves. The code then can detect when the mouse is over a certain character to change the image on the left to that character. The piece of code that does the change is the ‘img class=” main-image-character”’.  This works when an image is hovered over it will then change the link of that image and display the image.</p>
<p>When a customer is at the checkout page, there is a piece of code that communicates with the server and keeps all the details about that customer if they have used the website before. The code can be found when opening the checkout folder and is called ‘?ct=ejuxbcg9cpr6kx35l86y69yjj’. This code is where it communicates with Digicert to establish an encrypted communication between the user and the server. It then remembers some of your details like your address and card details. Plus has code that will let the user put in a new address and card details. There are also checks implemented into the code so that when you enter a name it only allows text and when entering a card number, it only allows you to enter numbers. This then communicates with the server to verify the order and to also check the bank that the card is registered to. This code is secure as you cannot change any of the code that is on the page which means that no one could edit the code and steal customers data such as card details or address. </p>
